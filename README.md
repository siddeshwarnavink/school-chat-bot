# School Charbot
This is really simple chat bot which can fetch the data from database and display it in chat message.

## Get started
Clone this repo to get started:

```
git clone <repo-url>
```

## Setup and installation
If you haven’t installed Rasa NLU and Rasa Core yet, you can do it by navigating to the project directory and running:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to install a spaCy English language model. You can install it by running:

```
python -m spacy download en
```

## Executable commands
1. You can train the Rasa NLU model by running:  
```make train-nlu```  
This will train the Rasa NLU model and store it inside the `/models/current/nlu` folder of your project directory.

2. Train the Rasa Core model by running:  
```make train-core```  
This will train the Rasa Core model and store it inside the `/models/current/dialogue` folder of your project directory.

3. In a new terminal start the server for the custom action by running:  
```make action-server```  
This will start the server for emulating the custom action.

4. Test the assistant by running:  
```make cmdline```  
This will load the assistant in your terminal for you to chat.

## Code Style

To ensure a standardized code style we use the formatter [black](https://github.com/ambv/black).
If your code is not formatted properly, travis will fail to build.

If you want to automatically format your code on every commit, you can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
Install it via `pip install pre-commit` and execute `pre-commit install`.

If you want to set it up manually, install black via `pip install black`.
To reformat files execute
```
black .
```
